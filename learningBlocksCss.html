    <p>Block-level elements form a visible block on a page — </br>
        they will appear on a new line from whatever content went before it, and any content that goes after it will also appear on a new line. <br>
        Block-level elements tend to be structural elements on the page that represent, for example, paragraphs, lists, navigation menus, footers, etc. <br>
        A block-level element wouldn't be nested inside an inline element, but it might be nested inside another block-level element. </p>
       
        <p>Inline elements are those that are contained within block-level elements and surround </p><br>
        only small parts of the document’s content, not entire paragraphs and groupings of <br>
        content. An inline element will not cause a new line to appear in the document; they <br>
        would normally appear inside a paragraph of text, for example an <a> element (hyperlink) or emphasis elements such as em or strong.
