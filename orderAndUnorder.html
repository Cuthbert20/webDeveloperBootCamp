           There are many things I want to Tell <span>You</span> before I die. Being your dad has been the greatest joy of my life. Every day I am your dad I feel myself getting
           a little better. Hope Did I get so luck to have <span>You</span>. I honestly don't know but, I am just going to roll with it! I miss you a lot. Thank you for letting me 
           be your dad. <span>Miss You</span>.
